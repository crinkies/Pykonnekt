# Pykonnekt
Pykonnekt is an unobtrusive internet reconnection tool, and my first project in a week of learning Python. I wrote this for use with a laptop with a failing network adapter, but have started using it across all my devices.

To setup, run the program and edit the Network.txt file in your \Documents\Pykonnekt\ folder with your network address.
The file icon.ico will be automatically downloaded, but must be in the \Documents\Pykonnekt\ folder to run.

The controls are Ctrl+Shift+X to check disconnects, and  Ctrl+Shift+Z to exit the program. 
It runs quietly in the background (No console) while reconnecting the internet. 

The included Install.bat is what I used to set up the program on some of my machines (provided Python 3 is installed).
It copies the file to your \Documents\Pykonnekt\ folder and adds shortcuts in the startup folder.

Requirements: keyboard, plyer
